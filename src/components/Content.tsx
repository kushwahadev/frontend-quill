          We prioritize threat modeling based on platform-specific risks.
          Security-first, we identify and mitigate vulnerabilities beyond
          functionality testing. Using white-box and black-box tests, we conduct
          thorough vulnerability assessments. Maintaining transparency, we
          communicate openly with the CDP team. Emphasizing clarity, we present
